# Investment Calculator

This is a tiny project that i developed so i could start practicing using React again after months of using only Angular as a front-end framework.

How to use it:
- Set the amount of your current savings;
- Set the amount of yearly savings;
- Set how much interest per year the investment will yield;
- Set how long the investment duration is;
- Click calculate and ... BOOM!
- Be amazed with the power of compound interest.
